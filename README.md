## Problem Statement
To reduce social interactions and points of contact amongst the community by implementing a favour system targeted at high risk groups within your housing block through an application in a Post-Covid world.

## Solution
In order to tackle the above stated problem statement, our group came up with an application that aims to connect residents in a neighbourhood through a favour system platform. 

The application allows users to help one another when doing everyday common tasks by allowing a single person to collate requests with the same destination, thus eliminating common points of contact and social interaction.

### Feature 1 - Shared Bulletin Board

The first feature of our application offers a bulletin board that is shared between residents staying in the same block. Here, residents can look at the current requests available in the building. When a person wishes to travel to a location, they could first take a look at the bulletin board to see if any requests are in line with their current destination. If so, the person could accept the request and do a favor for their neighbours.

### Feature 2 - Creating Offers

The second feature allows the creation of requests (Groceries, Food or Collection of Parcels). Users are able to post their own request by inserting the title, brief description of their wanted purchase and can also indicate if a tip is given to the user. Once the post has been filled up, the user can complete his request post by clicking on the confirmation button (Green Tick).

### Feature 3 - Managing Requests

The third feature allows users to manage their own requests. Users are able to view their own personalised request list that they have posted. This also allows users to know if their request have been accepted or still in pending. 


### Feature 4 - Managing Accepted Requests

The fourth feature allows users to manage the requests that they have accepted. Users are able to view what are the requests that they have accepted in a bulletin board. This allow the user to refer and purchase the items accordingly to what was listed out by the requestors. Furthermore, it also provides the requestor's house unit number which allows the user to drop the delivery at the requestor's unit.

### Feature 5 - Sign Up

The application has a simple and easy design, which is very friendly to all users. All the user have to do is to fill up the required information (Name, Phone number, Postal Code and Unit No.) and the application is good to go.
